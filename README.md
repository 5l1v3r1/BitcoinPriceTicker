# BitcoinPriceTicker

I used to use BTCquote.com for my price ticker on http://honeybadgerofmoney.com.  For the past few months it has been offline....well I had some time so I figure why not?  So I present you with this lightweight JQuery Price ticker tool with a few improvements.

1) DEAD simple to make this into whatever cryptocurrency you want!  

2) Using Flickr API it finds a random image to fill in the background based on keywords of your choosing.  Want an Ethereum Theme Ticker?  Done!  How about a Litecoin Ticker?  Done!  

3) JQuery was used so I could make easy JSON calls...if you choose, you could replace that portion with vanilla JS instead!

Here is the Ticker in Action:
